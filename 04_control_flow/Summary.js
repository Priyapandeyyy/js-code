// We don't want to execute all code in one time.
// We want control that if we have certain condition that certain code will execute.
 
// We have done example like temperature, userLoggedIn.

// Then we see how we prove true or false in conditions like :
// <, >, <=, >=, !=, ==, ===, !==

// Then we learn that when we declare something in scope then it is only in scope, it does not comes out of scope.

// Then we see that we can write multiple lines in If condition using ',' and also we don't need curly braces in this.

// Then we learn about else if to check multiple condition.

// Then we learn to check multiple conditon by using && and ||.

// Then we check Switch condition.

// We sometimes have to write too many if and else conditon so to shorten it we use switch conditon

// Switch ondition has one problem which is break.

// If we don't write break condition then every else confition under that will also execute except default.

// Then we check truthy and falsy.

// We learn rules about truthy and falsy values.

// We learn about Nullish Coalescing Operator and Terniary Operator.
