const name = "Priya"

// console.log(name + repoCount + " Value");
// This syntax is old. Noone writes it now.

// We use backtix nowadays.

console.log(`Hello my name is ${name} and my repo count is ${repoCount}`);  // ==> ouput will be the full sentence.

// We use dollar sign $ o evaluate and embed expressions dynamically in template literals.

const gameName = new String('PriyaPp');  // String can also be defined like this.
// If we write above method on console ten we will get characters numbers, length nd prototypes and many more.

console.log(gameName[1]);  // to access key we use [].
console.log(gameName.__proto__);  //One of the easiest way to find object.


console.log(gameName.length);
// Learning all these prototypes is learning string thoroughly
// WE CAN GENERATE ALL THESE METHODS FROM CONSOLE.
